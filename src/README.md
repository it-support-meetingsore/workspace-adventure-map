# WorkAdventure Map Starter Kit - Src Folder

In this directory you can put your scripts and other source code files.

- If you add some functionality like open door or else, you need to run npm run build, and then go to dist folder
  after that you copy main-<randomnumber>.js copy it and paste it with the location same as with the map.tmj
